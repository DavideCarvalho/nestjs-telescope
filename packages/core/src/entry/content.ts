/**
 * A browser-reported error ingested via the public `POST /api/client-errors`
 * endpoint (see {@link EntryType.ClientException}). Everything beyond `message`
 * is optional because the browser is UNTRUSTED — the controller validates the
 * structure and length-caps the strings before recording, and `extra` (an
 * arbitrary, host-defined bag of debugging context) is bounded by the normal
 * redaction budget at record time exactly like every other content payload.
 *
 * Field intent:
 *  - `message`        — the error message (required; the one field we insist on).
 *  - `name`           — the error class/name (e.g. `TypeError`), when the browser
 *                       supplied one. Feeds the family hash alongside `message`.
 *  - `stack`          — the JS stack string. Its TOP frame also feeds the family
 *                       hash, mirroring how server exceptions group.
 *  - `componentStack` — React's component stack (from an error boundary), kept
 *                       separate from `stack` so the dashboard can show both.
 *  - `url`            — the page URL where the error happened (the front-end
 *                       analogue of a request route).
 *  - `userAgent`      — the reporting browser's UA string.
 *  - `user`           — a host-supplied user identity (id/_id/email pivoted into
 *                       a `user:<id>` tag, mirroring the server `userTagger`).
 *  - `release`        — an app version / build id, so errors can be grouped by
 *                       deploy.
 *  - `extra`          — free-form debugging context; redacted/bounded like any
 *                       other content (never trusted to be small or shallow).
 *  - `clientIp`       — filled in BY THE SERVER from `request.ip` / the first
 *                       `x-forwarded-for` hop; never read from the body.
